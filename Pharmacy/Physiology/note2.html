            <h2>Hormone Basics</h2>
            
            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>What Is a Hormone?</h3>
                <p>Hormones are chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands that are released into the bloodstream to reach distant target cells. They ensure precise communication across the body, coordinating various physiological processes.</p>
                <p>These chemical messengers can be classified into three main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peptides and proteins</strong> - Water-soluble hormones that cannot cross cell membranes</li>
                    <li><strong>Steroids</strong> - Lipid-soluble hormones derived from cholesterol</li>
                    <li><strong>Amines</strong> - Including catecholamines and thyroid hormones with variable solubility</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="999.jpg">
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Receptor-Mediated Specificity</h3>
                <p>Each hormone binds only to its specific receptor, much like a key fitting into a lock. This precise binding triggers defined cellular responses that maintain internal balance (homeostasis).</p>
                <p>There are two main types of hormone receptors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Membrane receptors</strong> - Located on the cell surface, using second messengers like cAMP or IP3</li>
                    <li><strong>Nuclear receptors</strong> - Located inside cells, directly affecting gene transcription</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Homeostasis Guardians</h3>
                <p>Hormones maintain homeostasis by adjusting metabolism, growth, and reproduction. They keep critical parameters like temperature, glucose levels, and electrolyte concentrations within narrow, life-supporting ranges.</p>
                <p>This regulatory function ensures our bodies can adapt to changing internal and external environments while maintaining stability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Chemical Classes of Hormones</h3>
                <h4>Peptide and Protein Hormones</h4>
                <p>These hydrophilic molecules cannot cross cell membranes and act via surface receptors. They trigger intracellular second messengers like cAMP or IP3 to relay their signals throughout the cell.</p>
                
                <h4>Steroid Hormones</h4>
                <p>Derived from cholesterol, these lipophilic hormones can penetrate cell membranes and bind to nuclear receptors. They directly alter gene transcription and protein synthesis, with effects that can last from hours to days.</p>
                
                <h4>Amine Hormones</h4>
                <p>This category includes catecholamines and thyroid hormones. They exhibit variable solubility, with some acting on surface receptors and others entering cells to affect gene expression.</p>
                <img src="ppp.jpg" alt="Illustration of different hormone types">
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Receptor Types and Signaling</h3>
                <h4>Membrane Receptors</h4>
                <p>These receptors use second messengers such as cAMP, IP3, or kinase cascades to rapidly transmit hormonal signals from the cell surface to intracellular targets. This allows for quick cellular responses to hormonal signals.</p>
                
                <h4>Nuclear Receptors</h4>
                <p>Lipid-soluble hormones bind these receptors inside the cell. The hormone-receptor complex then attaches to specific DNA response elements, modulating gene transcription over hours to days, leading to longer-lasting effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Hormone Transport and Half-Life</h3>
                <h4>Protein Binding Extends Duration</h4>
                <p>Steroids and thyroid hormones bind to plasma proteins, which prolongs their half-life and buffers against sudden fluctuations in hormone levels. This creates a reservoir of hormone that can be released as needed.</p>
                
                <h4>Free Peptides Are Short-Lived</h4>
                <p>Peptide hormones circulate unbound and are rapidly degraded by enzymes in the blood and tissues. This results in short half-lives (minutes), allowing for quick adjustments in physiological responses.</p>
                
                <h4>Clearance Mechanisms</h4>
                <p>The liver and kidneys metabolize and excrete hormones. The efficiency of these clearance mechanisms determines how long each hormone remains active in the bloodstream.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Endocrine vs Neural Control</h3>
                <h4>Speed and Precision of Neural Signals</h4>
                <p>Neurons transmit signals within milliseconds, offering spatial precision and rapid reversibility. This makes neural control ideal for immediate reflexes and acute responses to environmental changes.</p>
                
                <h4>Endocrine Breadth and Persistence</h4>
                <p>Hormones act over seconds to hours, broadcast systemically throughout the body via the bloodstream. They persist until metabolized, making them suited for widespread, long-lasting regulatory effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Pulsatile and Circadian Secretion</h3>
                <h4>Pulsatile Patterns Prevent Desensitization</h4>
                <p>Many hormones are released in rhythmic bursts rather than continuously. This pattern maintains receptor sensitivity and ensures a wide dynamic range for physiological responses, preventing receptor down-regulation.</p>
                
                <h4>Circadian Rhythms Align Metabolism</h4>
                <p>Clock genes entrain hormones like cortisol and melatonin, synchronizing metabolic processes with daily sleep-wake and feeding cycles. This alignment optimizes energy utilization throughout the day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Assessing Hormone Action</h3>
                <h4>Plasma Assays Measure Concentration</h4>
                <p>Blood tests quantify hormone levels, but concentration does not always equate to biological activity. Interpretation requires understanding of the clinical context, binding proteins, and target tissue responsiveness.</p>
                
                <h4>Dynamic Testing Evaluates Reserve</h4>
                <p>Stimulation or suppression tests probe glandular capacity and feedback integrity. These tests can reveal subclinical dysfunction before basal hormone levels change significantly.</p>
                
                <h4>Integrated Biomarkers Reflect Activity</h4>
                <p>Target-tissue responses, genomic signatures, and metabolic fluxes provide a holistic view of hormone effectiveness in living organisms, beyond simple concentration measurements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Endocrine Disruptors Overview</h3>
                <h4>Chemical Mimics Block Hormones</h4>
                <p>Environmental substances like bisphenols and pesticides can bind hormone receptors, either blocking or exaggerating natural signals. This interference can derail normal development and physiological processes.</p>
                
                <h4>Transgenerational Epigenetic Effects</h4>
                <p>Early-life exposure to endocrine disruptors can modify gene expression patterns that persist across generations. This highlights critical windows of vulnerability during development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Hormone Synthesis Pathways</h3>
                <h4>Peptide Route</h4>
                <p>Gene transcription → mRNA → ribosomal preprohormone → signal peptide cleaved in ER → prohormone packaged into secretory granules → mature hormone released upon stimulation.</p>
                
                <h4>Steroid Route</h4>
                <p>Cholesterol imported or synthesized → side-chain cleavage in mitochondria → sequential enzymatic modifications in smooth ER and cytosol → final steroid hormone product.</p>
                
                <h4>Amine Route</h4>
                <p>Tyrosine uptake → hydroxylation to L-DOPA → decarboxylation to dopamine → β-hydroxylation to norepinephrine → N-methylation to epinephrine (in adrenal medulla).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Autocrine vs Paracrine vs Endocrine</h3>
                <h4>Autocrine Signaling</h4>
                <p>A cell secretes a hormone that binds to receptors on itself, creating self-regulating feedback loops for rapid local adjustments in cellular activity.</p>
                
                <h4>Paracrine Signaling</h4>
                <p>Secreted molecules diffuse through interstitial fluid to neighboring cells, coordinating tissue responses without entering the bloodstream.</p>
                
                <h4>Endocrine Signaling</h4>
                <p>Hormones travel via blood to distant organs, allowing integrated systemic control of growth, metabolism, and reproduction throughout the body.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Illustration of different signaling types">
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Negative Feedback Loops</h3>
                <h4>Physiological Brake System</h4>
                <p>Rising hormone levels directly or indirectly inhibit further release, preventing extreme fluctuations and maintaining set-point stability. This is the most common regulatory mechanism in endocrine systems.</p>
                
                <h4>Insulin Example</h4>
                <p>Post-prandial insulin lowers blood glucose, and the resulting hypoglycemia suppresses β-cell secretion, protecting against excessive drops in blood sugar levels.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Positive Feedback Example</h3>
                <h4>Accelerating Cascade</h4>
                <p>Output stimulates even more output until an endpoint is reached, creating rapid, self-limiting surges critical for specific biological events like childbirth and ovulation.</p>
                
                <h4>Ovulatory Estradiol Surge</h4>
                <p>Mid-cycle estradiol peaks stimulate hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary LH release, culminating in the LH surge that triggers ovulation - a classic example of positive feedback.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Receptor Down-Regulation</h3>
                <h4>Desensitization Mechanism</h4>
                <p>Persistent high hormone concentrations reduce receptor number or affinity, blunting cellular responsiveness and protecting against overstimulation.</p>
                
                <h4>Clinical Relevance</h4>
                <p>This phenomenon explains tolerance to therapeutic agents such as β-agonists in asthma or levodopa in Parkinson disease, requiring dose adjustments or drug holidays.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Receptor Up-Regulation</h3>
                <h4>Sensitization Strategy</h4>
                <p>Low hormone levels increase receptor synthesis or binding affinity, amplifying tissue sensitivity when signal availability is limited.</p>
                
                <h4>Prolactin During Pregnancy</h4>
                <p>An example where receptor up-regulation prepares mammary tissue for lactation in response to increasing prolactin levels during pregnancy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Second Messenger Systems</h3>
                <h4>cAMP Pathway</h4>
                <p>Hormone binds G-protein-coupled receptor → GDP-GTP exchange on Gαs subunit → GTP-Gαs activates adenylyl cyclase → converts ATP to cyclic AMP → cAMP activates protein kinase A → phosphorylation of target proteins → signal terminated by phosphodiesterase and intrinsic GTPase activity.</p>
                
                <h4>IP3-Calcium Cascade</h4>
                <p>Gq-coupled receptors activate phospholipase C → cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and DAG → IP3 diffuses to ER and opens Ca2+ channels → cytosolic Ca2+ increases → Ca2+ binds DAG to activate protein kinase C → Ca2+-calmodulin complexes activate additional kinases and phosphatases.</p>
                
                <h4>Catalytic Receptors</h4>
                <p>Guanylyl cyclase receptors activated by ANP and nitric oxide → convert GTP to cGMP → activates protein kinase G → phosphorylates targets for vasodilation and natriuresis. Tyrosine kinase receptors undergo autophosphorylation upon ligand binding → create docking sites for adaptor proteins → activate downstream signaling cascades.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Steroid Hormone Action</h3>
                <p>Lipid-soluble steroids pass plasma and nuclear membranes unaided → reach cytosolic or nuclear receptors → hormone-receptor complex binds to specific DNA sequences → alters gene transcription → new protein synthesis → cellular response. The time lag between hormone binding and observable effect reflects the time needed for protein synthesis.</p>

                <h3>Portal Circulation Anatomy</h3>
                <h4>Private Vascular Highway</h4>
                <p>Primary capillaries in the median eminence capture releasing hormones, and portal veins deliver them undiluted to the anterior pituitary, bypassing systemic circulation.</p>
                
                <h4>Rapid Concentrated Delivery</h4>
                <p>This arrangement ensures that minute quantities of hypothalamic factors reach their target cells within seconds, enabling precise control of pituitary function.</p>
